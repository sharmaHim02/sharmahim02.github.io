									<h3>My Learnings</h3>
									<p>This section shows some of the certificates and courses I've completed outside my curiculm. Most of the courses I've done were free so I don't have certificates to show but I learnt a lot from them and I guess that's what matters.</p>
									<ul class="feature-icons">
										<li class="icon solid fa-code"><b>Udemy Web Development Bootcamp</b><br>In the updated Web Developer Bootcamp, I focused on over 10 hours of React content, learning key concepts like JSX, state management, and React design patterns. With a comprehensive overhaul for the 2023 job market, the course covers 60+ hours of new material, including projects like YelpCamp. From HTML5 and CSS3 to deployment and security, it equips learners for real-world development.</li>
										<li class="icon solid fa-quote-left"><b>Google DSA certificate</b><br>In Google's Tech Dev Guide, I accessed curated resources covering programming fundamentals, data structures, algorithms, and interview prep. Whether a novice or experienced coder, the guide offered materials to supplement learning and prepare for interviews, sourced from various providers, including Google. It provided a comprehensive pathway to enhance technical skills and excel in the tech industry.</li>
										<li class="icon solid fa-terminal"><b>LinkedIn COBOL Certificate</b><br>In Peggy Fisher's COBOL course, I learned vital skills for updating existing codebases, covering data types, control structures, and file processing. This practical training prepares me to navigate COBOL environments confidently, enhancing my career prospects in critical systems development.</li>
										<li class="icon solid fa-laptop-code"><b>Simplilearn Python programming</b><br>In this introductory Python course, beginners delve into programming fundamentals, mastering variables, functions, and lists. From understanding error detection to working with files and classes, learners gain essential skills to navigate Python's syntax and structure. With a focus on foundational concepts and intermediate Python techniques, this course provides a solid foundation for further exploration and development in Python programming.</li>

									<h3>A Few Accomplishments</h3>
									<p>These are some of the Projects I've worked on during my college terms. You can click on the image to see the source code of it.</p>

											<a href="https://github.com/sharmaHim02/ZZlibrary" class="image"><img src="images/ZZlibrary.png" alt="image of the index page of my project."></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>ZZ Library</h4>
												<p>This is a Web Development project. I used html, csss, javaScript and PHP to complete this project. In this project I woreked in a team, I had 2 other students with me. This project is all what it sounds like. We created a working website for book catalouging. In the website users can creat their account and add books in thier "want to read", "Reading" and "Read" category. We used a database to store the data and used PHP to link it with the front end of the website. We also did front end and backend verification of user information with Java Script and PHP. I did the front end, database and some of the php of the whole project.</p>

											<a href="https://github.com/sharmaHim02/Pizza-Shop-Order-Handler" class="image"><img src="images/pizza.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Pizza Shop Order Handler</h4>
												<p>This is Java coding project. In this, I created a software for a Pizza shop to register orders efficiently and to maintain the work flow. To make the code robust and efficient I used OOP concepts like Polymorphism, Inheritance and Abstraction. Also to make it more efficient and quick I used collection structures like ArrayList, Linkedlist and Iterrator.In the end used formatted printing to make the output understadable to the user.</p>

											<a href="https://github.com/sharmaHim02/Patient-Record-handler-and-BMI-Calculator" class="image"><img src="images/bmi.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Patient Record handler and BMI Calculator</h4>
												<p>This one is also a Java Project. This project is a BMI Calculator for a hospital, this software allows the user to enter the data about the pateint and based on the age, weight and height, it calculates the BMI of the pateint. To make this project robust and efficient I used OOP concepts, built 6 different classes for binded them using Inheritance and other methods. To make sure everything works well and does not fall apart I did Junit testing of each class.</p>

											<a href="https://github.com/sharmaHim02/Alchohol-Beverage-Collection" class="image"><img src="images/beveragecollection.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Alcoholic Beverages Collection</h4>
												<p>This is a database project. I worked in the team of 3 for this project. I was responsible for the backend functionality of the project. This project is a beverage collection database which lets user add, delete and update the data of the alchohol collection. I used Oracle SQL to complete the backend functionality of the project. The special thing of this project is the "History Field", we made 3 fields historical, which means, if a user insert, update or delete the data from those fields, a start date and end date will be updated according to the command. I created views, triggers, procedures, sequences and packages to make this whole thing workable.</p>

											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Grade Calculator script in Linux</h4>
												<p>I made this project in linux, using vim. I wrote a script to let user enter their numeric grades and they would get alohabetic grades calculated. I used concepts like functions, loops and conditional blocks to complete the whole idea of the project.</p>
